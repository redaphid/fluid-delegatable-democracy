# Fluid Delegatable Democracy
The following will try define why direct democracy would be fairest, given no human flaws or physical limitations. Then list each flaw, why it exists, and what we can do about it.

## Rationale
Given if all people were equal in terms of  the following:
* reasoning ability
* opinion
* education
* intelligence
* interest   
* rationality of opinion

and that the following is true of the system:
* ungameable
* uncoercable
* everyone has infinite time to thoroughly examine the consequences of every government action.

then the fairest government would be a direct democracy for every atomic action a government could perform, and the result of every vote would be unanimous.

## Defining the Ideal Direct Democracy If the Givens Were True

* Everybody has one vote
* That vote applies to every law
  * _That vote may apply to court cases?_
  * _Maybe every court case is a law?_
    * _Even restraining orders and personal stuff?_
* Votes can never be forced or coerced.

## The Problem

  The givens are not true, so we must devise a system that approximates the above, given the constraints of the real world.


## Optimizations and Compromises, Given the Givens Aren't True

### Reasoning Ability
* Below a certain ability to reason, a citizen's vote can have a harmful effect on society.
* The harmful votes should be blocked by restricting who can vote if their reasoning ability is below a certain threshold.
* Many versions of this assesment may easily be subjective discriminatory, or wrong. Restrictions should be added with extreme caution, and may require a Direct Democratic Vote (more on this later).

#### Restriction of Voting Rights Due To Reasoning Ability
* Reasoning ability varies with age.
* 18 seems to be a generally accepted current age after which reasoning ability is sufficient to vote.
* Children under the age of 18 cannot vote.


======== somewhere else ========
  * Votes can be delegated to anyone who allows it.
  * Delegation can be changed at very frequent intervals (monthly?)

* Citizens can decide to accept delegations.
  * People can choose to display that they are accepting delegations
  * ~~These delegations can be accepted by arbitrary rules.~~
  * ~~People can choose to display the rules.~~
  * May only allow all-or-nothing delegate acceptance, to prevent some kind of discrimination.
  * Upon receiving delegations, all you are notified of is the count, which may be delayed.
  * It's possible you don't even know the count? No.
  * Citizens delegating their vote can see what the delegated voted for.

* A citizen with delegated votes can delegate their delegated votes.
  * Maybe this is opt in for recursion?
  * Opt in to both displaying and accepting all anonymous aspects of voting bools and ints.
  * These privacy settings can only be changed at a frequent (monthly?) review, during which time other laws aren't passed
  * Like defragging a hard drive.
  * People can decide to choose to display their voting power publicly.
  * Maybe with a minimum of 1?
  * Signable. Everyone has public keys that are not known to anyone but them by default. But it must be knowable that it is from a single person from birth, who is not dead.
* Crazy : chips like mine, scanned on death, death certificate signed by private key of deceased "public figure" (could be a requirement of a coroner)

* Change of core rules requires no delegation, 2/3 majority, long test drive period, with very frequent revert points (maybe yearly:monthly?)
  * This includes this initial system, assuming it's a branch of direct democracy backing the existing US legal system. (but this would be considered a catastrophic failure requiring the constant attention of the nation in order to avoid tyranny, explicitly)
  * This is based on the core philosophy that, given that time, interest, education, and flaws in reasoning are not issues, the fairest possible democracy is a direct democracy.
  * "hot", easy to revert laws that get "cooler" and "more solid" over time.


* Country - within - a - country cult
    1. Business
    2. Estate
    3. "Cult"
    4. Country-in-country
    5. Country
    6. World

* Possibly import some or all of the local laws into this system.
  
* Anybody can submit a government action or modification.
  * Delegating a vote may also delegate this power.
  * Submitting a government action can only be done at a long interval (Monthly? Yearly?)
  * The more "voting power" you have, the shorter the interval is.
