* Every person over the age of 18 has exactly 1 vote
  * That vote can be applied to any laws
  * Maybe even cases somehow? Randomly?
  * Maybe these are 2 different kinds of votes?
  * Votes can be delegated to anyone who allows it.
  * Delegation can be changed at very frequent intervals (monthly?)

* Citizens can decide to accept delegations.
  * People can choose to display that they are accepting delegations
  * ~~These delegations can be accepted by arbitrary rules.~~
  * ~~People can choose to display the rules.~~
  * May only allow all-or-nothing delegate acceptance, to prevent some kind of discrimination.
  * Upon receiving delegations, all you are notified of is the count, which may be delayed.
  * It's possible you don't even know the count? No.
  * Citizens delegating their vote can see what the delegated voted for.

* A citizen with delegated votes can delegate their delegated votes.
  * Maybe this is opt in for recursion?
  * Opt in to both displaying and accepting all anonymous aspects of voting bools and ints.
  * These privacy settings can only be changed at a frequent (monthly?) review, during which time other laws aren't passed
  * Like defragging a hard drive.
  * People can decide to choose to display their voting power publicly.
  * Maybe with a minimum of 1?
  * Signable. Everyone has public keys that are not known to anyone but them by default. But it must be knowable that it is from a single person from birth, who is not dead.
* Crazy : chips like mine, scanned on death, death certificate signed by private key of deceased "public figure" (could be a requirement of a coroner)

* Change of core rules requires no delegation, 2/3 majority, long test drive period, with very frequent revert points (maybe yearly:monthly?)
  * This includes this initial system, assuming it's a branch of direct democracy backing the existing US legal system. (but this would be considered a catastrophic failure requiring the constant attention of the nation in order to avoid tyranny, explicitly)
  * This is based on the core philosophy that, given that time, interest, education, and flaws in reasoning are not issues, the fairest possible democracy is a direct democracy.
  * "hot", easy to revert laws that get "cooler" and "more solid" over time. March 23rd 2019


* Country - within - a - country cult
    1. Business
    2. Estate
    3. "Cult"
    4. Country-in-country
    5. Country
    6. World

* Possibly import some or all of the local laws into this system.
  
* Anybody can submit a government action or modification.
  * Delegating a vote may also delegate this power.
  * Submitting a government action can only be done at a long interval (Monthly? Yearly?)
  * The more "voting power" you have, the shorter the interval is.
